### User Story

```

So that I can view my policy details.
```

## Technologies

- React Native (+ Expo CLI)

3rd party libraries
- @react-navigation
- @react-native-async-storage/async-storage

### Notes

- You cannot proceed to the next page with either or both of the login fields blank. An error message will appear when this is attempted. 
- I chose React Native as I am currently learning it. It was nice learn how to use an API within React Native as I have never done it within that language before.
- I did not include tests. Sadly I struggled to impliment working tests. Therefore I prioritied the product.
- I added a small amount of css styling.
